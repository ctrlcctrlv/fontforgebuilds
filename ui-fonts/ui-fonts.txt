NOTE: With Cairo enabled, FontConfig is no longer used
for the font backend, so this information no longer
applies. It is left here in case FontConfig is ever
used in the future.

Place fonts that you want FontForge to use for its user
interface here. Common fonts to include would be:
* Cantarell (Main UI font)
* Inconsolata (Main monospace UI font)
* DejaVu Sans/Serif
* WenQuanYi / DroidSansFallbackFull (CJK fonts + a lot more)

If you instead wish for FontForge to use the Windows font
folder, you must manually enable this. This is disabled by
default because FontForge uses FontConfig, which scans the
Windows font directory every time a new font is added or
removed. This is a very slow process, and can take quite a
few minutes for FontForge to load on startup (it can take
up to 10 minutes, or even more!), which makes it appear as if
FontForge is freezing.

To enable scanning of the Windows font directory, edit the file
'fonts.conf', located in etc/fonts/fonts.conf, and uncomment
the appropriate line (follow instructions in that file).
